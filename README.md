# diffractive_hyperspectral_ml_model
Machine Learning Model for Diffractive Hyperspectral Imaging. The model can be trained on binocular data from a diffractive hyperspectral camera and a commercial hyperspectral camera.

## TODO

- Test different LR scheduler
- Try a Grad Scalar for optimizer
- Try smaller Unet



Some parts of the code are inspired by a tutorial by Aladdin Persson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuddDSqGRzg
